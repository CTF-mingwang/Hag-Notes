White Blood Cells (Leukocytes)

---

#### What Protein is responsible for carrying oxygen

Hemoglobin

---

#### Where is Red Blood Cells eliminated

Spleen and macrophage live in organ or liver

---

#### List and describe 3 types of anemia

- Caused by blood loss
- Caused by decreased or faulty RBC Production
- Caused by the destruction of RBC

---

#### What are the 2 categories of WBC? Name all of the WBC in their category

- Granulocytes
  - Neutrophil
  - Basophil
  - Eosinophil
- Agranulocytes
  - Lymphocytes
  - Monocytes

---

#### What is chemotaxis

Movement of a motil cell or organism, or part of one, in a direction, corresponding to a gradient of increasing or decreasing concentration of a particular substance

---

#### What type of Agranulocytes makes up 25% of WBC? What are the 2 subtypes and what do they do?

Lymphocytes

- T: immune response
- B: produce antibodies

---

#### Name 3 stages of hemostasis

- Vascular spasms
- Platelet Plug formation
- Coagulation (blood clotting)

---

#### What is the name of a clot in an unbroken blood vessel?

Thrombus

---

#### What is embolus

If the thrombus breaks away and floats freely in the bloodstream

---

#### What are the 3 different types of blood vessels? What do they do?

- Arteries
- Capillaries
- Veins

---

#### List the pathway of deoxygenated blood through the heart ending in the aorta

1. Veins -> Superior * inferior vena cava
2. Right Atrium -> Tricuspid Valve
3. Right Ventricles -> Pulmenary Valve -> Pulmenary Artery
4. Lung -> Gas exchange -> Pulmenary Veins
5. Left Atrium -> Bicuspid Valve -> Left Ventricle
6. Aortic Valve -> Aorta

---

#### What is the difference between semilunar and AV Valve

The valve between the left ventricle and the aorta is the aortic semilunar valve. When the ventricles contract, AV valve close to prevent blood from flowing back into the atria. When the ventricles relax, semilunar valves close to prevent blood from flowing back into the ventricles.

---

- Pulmenary
- Systemic

---

#### What are the 3 functions of the respiratory system?

- Gas exchange between the blood and the external environment
- Gas exchange within the lungs
- Purify, warm, humidify the incoming air

---

Diaphram
- Contracts: Inspiration, moves down
- Relaxes: Expiration, moves up
